# Scala Spark 2.3.0#
This contains enough boilerplate code to get you started with Apache Spark 2.x and Scala.

Make sure to change the version of Spark libraries in `build.sbt`. This project should work for any version of
Apache Spark 2.0.0 or greater.
#Server code for launching the workers. This is the master code#
